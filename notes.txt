Adafruit Thermal product #2751

You have to edit the thermal's baud rate. Notice "Baudrate:9600" on test printout!
In 
Arduino/libraries/Adafruit_Thermal_Printer_Library/Adafruit_Thermal.cpp
change
#define BAUDRATE  19200
to
#define BAUDRATE  9600

In
Arduino/libraries/Adafruit_Thermal_Printer_Library/Adafruit_Thermal.h
change
#define PRINTER_FIRMWARE 268
to
#define PRINTER_FIRMWARE 111

Wiring:

Green -> 6(rx)
Yellow -> 5(tx)
Black -> ground & 9V ground

Run the arduino example A_printertest. But edit it first:
change
mySerial.begin(19200);
to
mySerial.begin(9600);

If you get garbage characters, then the baudrate is wrong.
